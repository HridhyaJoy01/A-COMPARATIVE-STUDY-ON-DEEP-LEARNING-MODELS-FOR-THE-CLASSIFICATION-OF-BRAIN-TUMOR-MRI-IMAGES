This is a comparative study on 3 types of deep learning(machine learning) models for the classification of Brain Tumor MRI images.
This code compares which one is the best model among the three: A custom-built CNN model, A hybrid CNN-GRU model and a pre-trained Inception V3 model.
steps involved : 1) importing necessary libraries for the classification 
                 2) Data preprocessing
                 3) Data visualization
                 4) Image Augmentation
                 5) Train_validation_test split
                 5) Training of each model
                 6) Prediction using the best model
                 7) comparison
                 8) Feature selection 
This classification have used an image dataset from kaggle (Brain Tumor MRI dataset) Available at: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/masoudnickparvar/brain-tumor-mri-dataset. Which contains mostly JPEG format magnetic resonance images of brain tumors or no-tumors.
